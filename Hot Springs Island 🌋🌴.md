### Overview
- A fully open-ended hex crawl set on a volcanic island filled with feuding factions, lost elven ruins, strange creatures, and dangerous magical flora.
- Completely system-neutral, allowing it to be used with any OSR or other RPG system.
- Designed as a living, reactive world, where NPCs, factions, and creatures have their own goals and motivations.
- Heavy emphasis on exploration and factional play, with a high degree of player-driven storytelling.

### Tone & Inspirations
- Pulp fantasy meets hexcrawl survivalism‚Äîthink *King Kong* mixed with *Lost* and *Treasure Island*.
- The ruins of a fallen elven pleasure-seeking civilization litter the island, filled with lingering magic.
- Mesoamerican and Polynesian influences, with jungle environments, volcanic activity, and warring native groups.
- A world where the ecology itself is strange and dangerous‚Äîelemental-powered creatures, mind-altering plants, and unpredictable magical effects.
- Unlike classic OSR play, this setting focuses on emergent storytelling rather than dungeon crawls or treasure-as-XP mechanics. Magic is untamed, and standard fantasy races are absent, replaced by unique beings.

### Example Adventure Hooks
1. A valuable shipment of red crystal has gone missing, and both the Fuegonauts and Night Axe ogres blame each other. Can the players locate the real thieves and sell the loot before getting caught in the crossfire?
2. The ruins of a sunken elven palace shimmer beneath the waves‚Äîbut the nereids whisper that something terrible sleeps within.
3. A rare jungle flower blooms only once a year, and multiple factions want it‚Äîsome for its healing properties, others for its mind-shattering effects.
4. A volcanic eruption is imminent, and an entire region of the island will soon be swallowed by lava. The party has only hours to plunder its secrets before they are lost forever.
