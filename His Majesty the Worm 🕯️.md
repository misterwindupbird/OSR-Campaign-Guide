A **structured, phase-based dungeon-crawling RPG** set in a vast, mythic **Underworld** beneath a sprawling **City**.

---

### Overview
- A game of **deep survival, resource management, and subterranean intrigue**.
- **Dungeons are the heart of play**, focusing on **logistical survival, strategic exploration, and inter-party relationships**.
- Uses **tarot cards instead of dice**, adding an **interpretive, fate-driven approach** to randomness.
- Highly **procedural**, with play divided into **four structured phases**:  
  1. **Crawl Phase** – Dungeon exploration and encounters.  
  2. **Challenge Phase** – Combat and major obstacles.  
  3. **Camp Phase** – Rest, recovery, and relationship development.  
  4. **City Phase** – Faction play, downtime, and resupply.  

The deeper you go, the more **the Underworld changes you**.

### Tone & Inspirations
- **Dark fantasy with mythic surrealism**—the **Underworld is alive, alien, and endless**.  
- **Inspirations:**  
  - *Dungeon Meshi (Delicious in Dungeon)* – Survival-driven dungeon delving, food as resource, inter-party dynamics.  
  - *The Castle of Crossed Destinies* – Narrative shaped by **tarot and fate**.  
  - *The Silver Chair* – **A vast, hidden world beneath the surface**, ruled by strange powers.  
  - **Underworld mythology** – Ancient cities swallowed by time, rulers whose courts stretch beyond the grave.  

It feels like **survival horror meets underground mythology**, where every delve is a **journey of no return**.  

Compared to **classic OSR play**, it retains:  
- **Dungeon logistics** (light, hunger, encumbrance, deadly combat).  
- **Factions, shifting alliances, and a living ecosystem**.  
- **High lethality and hard choices**.  

But introduces:  
- **Phase-based play**, structuring downtime, exploration, and relationships.  
- **No Vancian magic**—instead, alchemy, relics, and ancient pacts.  
- **No Tolkien-style races**—play as **humans, fay, underfolk, or orcs**, each with unique perspectives.

### Gameplay & Features

#### 🏰 The Underworld
- **A mythic labyrinth of tunnels, ruins, and impossible architecture**.  
- **Procedurally generated**, filled with **factions, lost cities, and forgotten gods**.  
- **Survival matters**—light, food, and stress must be managed at all times.  

#### 🏙️ The City at the Center of the World
- A hub for **downtime, intrigue, and faction play**.  
- Guilds offer support but **exert political and social pressure**.  
- Factions **vie for control of the Underworld**, creating **alliances, betrayals, and contracts**.  

#### 🌌 The Weirdness Beneath
- The **Underworld is an alien ecosystem**, full of:  
  - **Fungal forests**, **underground seas**, and **ruins from forgotten ages**.  
  - **Relics of the past**—from **dungeon gods to time-warped cities**.  
  - **Strange physics**, where **gravity shifts and darkness breathes**.  

#### 🐉 Monsters & Dungeon Ecology
- Monsters aren’t just **enemies**—they’re **part of a living ecosystem**.  
- Some are **intelligent factions** rather than simple threats.  
- Dungeons have **prey creatures, scavengers, and apex predators** that create emergent threats.  

#### ⚗️ Alchemy System
- **Harvest reagents from monsters** to craft potions, oils, and bombs.  
- **Each creature has unique properties**, e.g.:  
  - **Dire Spider** → Potion grants wall-climbing, Bomb inflicts venom, Oil creates sticky webs.  
  - **Harpy** → Potion grants flight, Bomb inflicts irrational hatred, Oil creates piercing wails.  
- **Reagents must be fresh**—alchemy **cannot be stockpiled easily**, forcing hard choices.  

#### 🔗 Character Bonds & Party Dynamics
- Instead of alignment, characters have **Bonds**—personal ties that evolve through play.  
- Bonds **grant mechanical benefits** but also **create tension and drama**.  
- Examples:  
  - **Mentor/Mentee**: *“I guided them when they were new to this world.”*  
  - **Rivalry**: *“We compete in everything—kills, treasure, and pride.”*  
  - **Big/Little**: *“We watch each other’s backs because one of us is small and the other is huge.”*  
- **Rivalries, debts, and lost loves** make rest phases as **tense as the dungeons themselves**.
