### **Tone & Inspirations:**

_A Thousand Thousand Islands_ is a deeply evocative setting inspired by Southeast Asian folklore, animist traditions, and oral storytelling. It eschews the typical medieval European fantasy tropes in favor of a world built on mangrove swamps, river spirits, and gods lurking in the roots of banyan trees. The setting is filled with microcultures, strange spirits, and non-human entities that operate on different logic than Western fantasy monsters.

_Lorn Song of the Bachelor_, as an adventure within this setting, focuses on a cursed, ever-respawning crocodile deity that terrorizes the locals, tying into the broader themes of animism, shifting identity, and colonial exploitation.


### **Unique Features & Gameplay:**

• The setting isn’t a single continent but a web of islands, each with its own rulers, customs, and supernatural entities.

• No central map—each book in the series describes an island in intimate detail, providing plot hooks, encounters, and cultural practices rather than rigid geography.

• Social, political, and supernatural conflicts are as important as combat. Players may bargain with spirits, make offerings to deities, or get caught in feuds between rival islands.

• Much of the horror comes from things left unsaid: disappearances, lingering curses, and dreamlike, unnerving encounters.

• _Lorn Song of the Bachelor_ is a perfect introduction to this world—centered around a reincarnating crocodile spirit tied to the land itself, an expedition into its lair may reveal more than just a way to kill the beast.

  

### **Example Hooks & Situations:**

• A village elder pleads for aid against a shapeshifting river spirit that has fallen in love with their child and refuses to let them leave.

• A noblewoman hires the PCs to recover her husband, who disappeared into a cave filled with the voices of his ancestors. The deeper one goes, the more those voices sound like his own.

• A group of rebels claim the colonial governor is actually an ancient crocodile spirit who has learned to walk on two legs. They’re asking for help proving it—before he devours them all.

  

### **OSR Compatibility & Weirdness:**

• Magic here is more animistic and folkloric—there’s no Vancian spellcasting or clerics praying to distant gods. Magic comes from deals with spirits, rituals, or consuming dangerous substances.

• The setting lacks Tolkien races entirely—no elves, dwarves, or orcs. Instead, you get islands full of spirits, haunted objects, and people who may not be entirely human.

• Treasure is often tied to cultural significance rather than generic gold and magic items. Players may need to learn the story behind a stolen artifact before they can safely sell it.

• Dungeons exist, but they’re often temples, flooded ruins, or places warped by divine curses rather than generic underground labyrinths.

  

### **Support & Availability:**

Each _A Thousand Thousand Islands_ book focuses on a different location, with gorgeous hand-drawn art and dense writing. There’s no single “core book” tying it all together, making it feel more like a travelogue than a traditional campaign setting. _Lorn Song of the Bachelor_ is one of the more structured adventures within this world, making it an ideal starting point.

  

### **Pros:**

• Incredibly rich, unique worldbuilding with a Southeast Asian perspective.

• Focus on folklore, oral traditions, and dreamlike storytelling.

• High social and narrative focus—combat is only part of the game.

• _Lorn Song of the Bachelor_ is a perfect, self-contained adventure to introduce players to the setting.

  

### **Cons:**

• No centralized campaign book—requires piecing together multiple smaller books.

• The world operates on different narrative and mythic logic than standard fantasy settings, which may require adjusting expectations.

• Some elements are more implied than spelled out, meaning GMs will need to fill in the gaps.

  

### **Who Would Love This?**

• Players who enjoy social and cultural intrigue more than dungeon crawling.

• GMs who love mythic storytelling, folklore, and dreamlike adventures.

• Groups looking for a completely fresh take on fantasy, without Western medieval influences.
