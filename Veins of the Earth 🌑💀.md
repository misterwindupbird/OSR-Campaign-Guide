# Veins of the Earth 🌑💀

![Veins of the Earth - Lamentations of the Flame Princess | DriveThruRPG](https://d1vzi28wh99zvq.cloudfront.net/images/2795/209509.jpg)


### What It Is
- A deep-time, underground nightmare setting by Patrick Stuart, illustrated by Scrap Princess.
- A surreal, horror-inflected take on cave exploration that treats the underworld as a completely alien, lightless realm, where physics, biology, and culture operate on utterly different principles.
- Designed for OSR-style play but with extreme mechanical and environmental hazards, making survival a grueling challenge.
- Less a traditional setting and more a generator of strange, inimical spaces filled with entities that obey no human logic.

### What Makes It Unique
- **Light is Life**: Unlike most fantasy settings, where dungeons are just dark places, *Veins of the Earth* treats light as a precious, dwindling resource. Running out of light isn’t just inconvenient—it means death, madness, or worse.
- **Survival Horror Underground**: The entire game is about managing resources in a hostile, oxygen-thin, food-scarce, impossibly vast cave system. Simple things like climbing and carrying weight are detailed with crushing realism.
- **Alien Cultures**: The underworld isn’t just full of monsters—it has entire civilizations that have evolved separately from surface-dwellers, with their own disturbing philosophies and economies.
- **The Madness of the Deep**: The setting doesn’t just punish physical frailty but mental resilience. Many of the creatures and environments induce slow, creeping existential dread.
- **Cave Generation Tools**: Not just a setting book, *Veins* provides deep procedures for generating realistic cave networks, complete with random tables for environmental hazards, bizarre treasures, and incomprehensible creatures.

### Tone & Inspirations
- *The Night Land*, Lovecraft’s darkest underworld imaginings, and the horror of deep, lightless spaces.
- Hard science meets fever-dream surrealism—bioluminescent ecosystems, alien fungi, underground oceans of liquid stone, and things that have never seen light.
- A deliberate rejection of surface-world fantasy tropes: no elves or dwarves, no convenient magic shops, no safe rest stops—only an infinite abyss of darkness.
- A mix of brutal survivalism and poetic weirdness. Some sections read like academic treatises on caving; others like a mad prophet’s ravings.

### What Play is Like
- **A Game of Paranoia**: Every step deeper feels like an existential mistake. Do you have enough light? Do you have enough food? What if the cave system ahead is unclimbable? What if you’re lost?
- **Avoid Combat**: Most enemies cannot be fought in traditional ways. They either ignore human-scale conflict or interact with the world on a cosmic, elemental level. Diplomacy, escape, and clever use of terrain are crucial.
- **Extreme Challenge**: *Veins* is designed to grind characters down, both physically and psychologically. There’s no “town” to go back to—just the ever-pressing dark.
- **Strange & Haunting Discoveries**: Finding a petrified, fossilized battlefield from a war fought millions of years ago is a standard reward in *Veins*. Treasure is usually enigmatic, dangerous, and unknowable.

### Made-Up Adventure Hooks
1. Your light is almost gone, but you see a faint, flickering glow ahead. A new type of luminous lichen? A colony of fungal beings that communicate by bioluminescence? Something far worse?
2. An ancient civilization sealed off an entire cave system behind miles of glass-smooth walls. Whatever is inside is still knocking to be let out.
3. The deeper you go, the harder it is to breathe. But there are beings that can trade you “breathable dark”—for a price.
4. A long-dead creature, impossibly large, is fused into the cavern walls. Inside its petrified ribcage is something still alive, whispering in a language no one has ever spoken.

### How Close to OSR Tropes?
- *Veins* takes some OSR elements—procedural generation, emergent gameplay, and brutal consequences—but completely rejects traditional fantasy.
- There are no classic dungeons, though caves serve a similar exploratory function.
- Treasure is not a focus—there is no “gold for XP” system, and what valuables exist are often incomprehensible or dangerous.
- Magic is alien and weird, more like ancient, barely understood technology than the Vancian spellcasting of traditional D&D.
- No Tolkien-style races—only bizarre, deep-dwelling civilizations like the **Knotsmen** (who trade memories as currency) or the **Dvargir** (who evolved in total darkness and now wage nihilistic war).

### Pros & Cons
✅ **Utterly unique**—nothing else in RPGs captures this particular mix of deep-earth horror and dreamlike surrealism.  
✅ **Powerful tools for procedural worldbuilding**—the cave generation system alone is worth stealing for other settings.  
✅ **Highly evocative writing and art**—Patrick Stuart’s prose is poetic, dense, and deeply weird, while Scrap Princess’ raw, scratchy illustrations reinforce the feeling of total alienation.  

❌ **Extremely difficult to play**—survival is punishing, and the setting is so vast and inhospitable that long campaigns often collapse under the weight of its bleakness.  
❌ **Mechanically demanding**—tracking light, weight, food, and vertical movement is crucial. This is not a setting for casual or rules-light groups.  
❌ **Somewhat incoherent in places**—the book is a mix of hard rules, experimental writing, and gonzo weirdness, sometimes making it hard to tell what is “real” in the world.  

### Who Should Play This?
- Fans of survival horror who want a fantasy setting where simply staying alive is the challenge.
- OSR groups looking for something truly different—this is not another pseudo-medieval world.
- People who love procedural generation and want to embrace emergent play.
- Groups that enjoy the alien and unknowable—if you like *Dark Souls*, *Blame!*, or the idea of roleplaying in an SCP document, this is your jam.
