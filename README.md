## 🏰 Classic OSR Dungeon Crawlers  

These are for people who love** dungeons. Not just _like_ them—_love_ them. You will think in 10-foot poles, track your rations down to the last crumb, and consider hirelings expendable. If you dream in grids and torches, welcome home.  

- **🏛️ Arden Vul** – The **cathedral** of OSR megadungeons: sprawling, full of factions, and unapologetically lethal.  
- **🏰 Stonehell Dungeon** – The **workhorse** of OSR dungeons: modular, expandable, lethal, and perfect for low-prep play.  
- **❄️ Gods of the Forbidden North** – Not **just** a dungeon but a savage arctic sandbox ("icebox"?) where _the world itself_ wants to kill you.  

✅ **Best for:** Players who enjoy **mapping, resource management, and tactical dungeoneering.**  
❌ **Skip if:** You want deep social play or character-driven storytelling—this is about **surviving the dungeon**, not **drama**.  

---

## 🌍 The Wilderness Hexcrawl & Procedural Settings  

Here, the real challenge isn’t goblins in a room—it’s the journey itself. These settings are vast, player-driven, and extremely open-ended. You’re not "completing a quest"—you’re carving a path through an indifferent, often bizarre world.  

- **🐪🚀 Ultraviolet Grasslands (UVG)** – The ultimate _Oregon Trail on acid_. Combat is dealy but logistics and bad decisions will be what kills you.  
- **🌋🌴 Hot Springs Island** – A hexcrawl that’s _alive_. No static encounters—everything reacts to players, making it a true sandbox.  
- **🏯 A Thousand Thousand Islands** – A dreamlike, Southeast Asian-flavored social and exploratory hexcrawl as much about culture as it is about adventure.  

✅ **Best for:** Players who like improvisation, and GMs who want to react to players, not railroad them.  
❌ **Skip if:** Your group needs structure—these can feel aimless without player-driven action.  

---

## 🌙 The Surreal & The Strange  

If you want to drown in weirdness, these settings deliver. The world does _not_ work like ours. Cause and effect are suggestions at best. Magic is frightening and unknowable.  

- **🌑💀 Veins of the Earth** – The _hardest, meanest, most oppressive survival horror_ in OSR. You are miles into the earth, and it wants you dead.  
- **🎭 Through Ultan’s Door** – The most dreamlike setting on the list. A forgotten Borges manuscript in campaign form.  
- **⚙️🛠️🧬 Anomalous Subsurface Environment (ASE)** – Imagine _Gamma World_, if Gary Gygax and Jack Vance were stoned out of their heads.  

✅ **Best for:** Deep roleplayers and explorers who thrive in alien environments.  
❌ **Skip if:** You want _clear objectives_ and _predictable mechanics_.  

---

## 🕵️ Faction & Intrigue Play (Social Combat > Dungeon Combat)  

These settings de-emphasize dungeon crawling in favor of climbing power structures, making alliances, and pulling off elaborate betrayals.  

- **🏮 Yoon-Suin** – Procedural opium-fueled nightmare intrigue. There’s no “official” setting—just generators for culture, factions, and stories.  
- **🌒🔪 Blades in the Dark** – The anti-OSR OSR game. Instead of _dying in a pit_, you _scheme, betray, and hustle your way to the top_.  
- **🕯️ His Majesty the Worm** – _Dungeon Meshi_ meets ritualized guild politics and intraparty drama. Less about loot, more about relationships and survival.  

✅ **Best for:** Players who want scheming, power plays, and influence over the world.  
❌ **Skip if:** Your group wants clear objectives and action-focused play—these settings are slow burns.

## 📊 OSR Settings Table  

#### ⭐ About the Ratings

These star ratings are NOT about quality!
They indicate how much emphasis the setting places on a particular element, not how “good” or “bad” it is.

For example:
	•	A 5-star Dungeon rating means dungeon-crawling is central to the setting, not that it’s the “best” dungeon crawl.
	•	A 1-star City rating means cities are minimal or not the focus, not that the city content is bad.

Think of this as a heat map for what each setting emphasizes! 🔥
