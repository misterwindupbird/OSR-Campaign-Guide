## 🏰 Classic OSR Dungeon Crawlers  

These are for people who **love** dungeons. Not just _like_ them—**love** them. You think in **10-foot poles**, track your rations down to the last crumb, and consider **hirelings expendable**. If you dream in **grids and torches**, welcome home.  

- **🏛️ Arden Vul** – The **cathedral** of OSR megadungeons: sprawling, full of factions, and unapologetically lethal.  
- **🏰 Stonehell Dungeon** – The **workhorse** of OSR dungeons: modular, expandable, lethal, and perfect for low-prep play.  
- **❄️ Gods of the Forbidden North** – Not **just** a dungeon but a savage arctic sandbox ("icebox"?) where _the world itself_ wants to kill you.  

✅ **Best for:** Players who enjoy **mapping, resource management, and tactical dungeoneering.**  
❌ **Skip if:** You want deep social play or character-driven storytelling—this is about **surviving the dungeon**, not **drama**.  

---

## 🌍 The Wilderness Hexcrawl & Procedural Settings  

Here, the **real challenge isn’t goblins in a room—it’s the journey itself**. These settings are **vast, player-driven, and open-ended**. You’re **not** "completing a quest"—you’re **carving a path through an indifferent, often bizarre world**.  

- **🐪🚀 Ultraviolet Grasslands (UVG)** – The ultimate _Oregon Trail on acid_. PCs will die **not** from combat but **from logistics and bad decisions**.  
- **🌋🌴 Hot Springs Island** – A hexcrawl that’s **alive**. No static encounters—everything reacts to players, making it a **true sandbox**.  
- **🏯 A Thousand Thousand Islands** – A dreamlike, Southeast Asian-flavored **social and exploratory** hexcrawl as much about **culture** as it is about **adventure**.  

✅ **Best for:** Players who **like improvisation**, and GMs who want to **react to players, not railroad them**.  
❌ **Skip if:** Your group **needs structure**—these can feel **aimless** without player-driven action.  

---

## 🌙 The Surreal & The Strange  

If you want to **drown your players in weirdness**, these settings deliver. The world does **not** work like ours. Cause and effect are **suggestions** at best. Magic is **unknowable**.  

- **🌑💀 Veins of the Earth** – The **hardest, meanest, most oppressive survival horror** in OSR. Space itself **wants you dead**.  
- **🎭 Through Ultan’s Door** – **The most dreamlike** setting on the list. A forgotten Borges manuscript **in campaign form**.  
- **⚙️🛠️🧬 Anomalous Subsurface Environment (ASE)** – Imagine **Gamma World, if Gary Gygax and Jack Vance were drunk**.  

✅ **Best for:** **Deep roleplayers and explorers** who thrive in **alien environments**.  
❌ **Skip if:** You want _clear objectives_ and _predictable mechanics_.  

---

## 🕵️ Faction & Intrigue Play (Social Combat > Dungeon Combat)  

These settings **de-emphasize dungeon crawling** in favor of **climbing power structures, making alliances, and pulling off elaborate betrayals**.  

- **🏮 Yoon-Suin** – **Procedural opium-fueled nightmare intrigue.** There’s no “official” setting—just **generators for culture, factions, and stories**.  
- **🌒🔪 Blades in the Dark** – **The anti-OSR OSR game.** Instead of _dying in a pit_, you _scheme, betray, and hustle your way to the top_.  
- **🕯️ His Majesty the Worm** – _Dungeon Meshi_ meets **ritualized guild politics and interparty drama**. Less about loot, **more about relationships and survival**.  

✅ **Best for:** Players who want **scheming, power plays, and influence** over the world.  
❌ **Skip if:** Your group wants **clear objectives and action-focused play**—these settings are **slow burns**.  

---

## 🛠️ Aside: How Much Weirdness Can Your Group Handle?  

📜 **Low (Classic OSR dungeon delves)?** → _Arden Vul, Stonehell_  
🌊 **Medium (Faction intrigue, exotic cultures)?** → _Yoon-Suin, A Thousand Thousand Islands_  
🌀 **MAXIMUM UNHINGED MADNESS?** → _Veins of the Earth, ASE_
