## **System Breakdown: Old School Brutality, Surrealist Journeys, and Faction Shenanigans**

At first glance, all these settings seem like **variations on OSR themes**, but there’s an **enormous difference in playstyle and mechanical crunch** lurking beneath the surface. Let’s break them down:

### **The Classic OSR Dungeon Crawlers (B/X, OSE, AD&D)**

These are for people who **love** dungeons. Not just like them—**love** them. The kind of people who think in **10-foot poles** and **hirelings as disposable assets** rather than charming side characters.

- **Arden Vul** – The **cathedral** of OSR megadungeons: sprawling, full of factions, and unapologetically lethal.
- **Stonehell Dungeon** – The **workhorse** of OSR dungeons: modular, expandable, lethal, and perfect for low-prep play.
- **Gods of the Forbidden North** – Not **just** a dungeon but a savage arctic sandbox ("icebox"?) where _the world itself_ wants to kill you.

✅ **Best for:** Players who enjoy **mapping, resource management, and tactical dungeoneering.**

❌ **Skip if:** You want deep social play or character-driven storytelling—this is about **surviving the dungeon**, not **drama**.

### **The Wilderness Hexcrawl / Procedural Settings**

The complement of dungeon-crawling—these are **vast, player-driven, and open-ended**. The real challenge isn’t goblins in a room, but **the journey itself**.

- **Ultraviolet Grasslands (UVG)** – The ultimate _Oregon Trail on acid_. PCs will die **not** because of combat but **logistics and bad decisions**.
- **Hot Springs Island** – A hexcrawl that’s **alive**. No static encounters—everything reacts to player actions, which makes it a **sandbox in the truest sense**.
- **A Thousand Thousand Islands** – A dreamlike, Southeast Asian-flavored **social and exploratory** hexcrawl that’s as much about **culture** as it is about **adventure**.

✅ **Best for:** Players who **like improvisation**, and GMs who want to **react to the players, not railroad them.**

❌ **Skip if:** Your group **needs structure**—these can feel **aimless** without player-driven action.

### **The Surreal and the Strange**

If you want to **drown your players in weirdness** and make them question **reality itself**, these settings deliver.

- **Veins of the Earth** – The **hardest, meanest, most oppressive survival horror** in OSR. Light is a resource. Madness is real. Space itself is out to kill you. It’s **brilliant but borderline unplayable as a long campaign**.
- **Through Ultan’s Door** – **The most dreamlike** setting on the list. Feels like running a campaign inside **a forgotten Borges manuscript**, where courtly intrigue happens **in a city that shouldn’t exist**.
- **Anomalous Subsurface Environment** – Imagine **Gamma World but if Gary Gygax and Jack Vance were drunk**. This is where **mutant cowboys** fight **robotic librarians** in the ruins of **Earth-but-not-Earth**.

✅ **Best for:** **Deep roleplayers and explorers** who thrive in **alien environments**.

❌ **Skip if:** You want _clear objectives_ and _predictable mechanics_. **This is not that.**

### **Faction and Intrigue Play (Social Combat > Dungeon Combat)**
  
These settings **de-emphasize dungeon crawling** and instead focus on **climbing power structures, backstabbing enemies, and making alliances**.

- **Yoon-Suin (The Yellow City)** – **Procedural opium-fueled nightmare intrigue.** Every session can **redefine the world**, because there’s no fixed setting—just **generators for culture, factions, and stories**.
- **Blades in the Dark** – **The anti-OSR OSR game.** PCs are **powerful criminals** rather than fragile nobodies. Instead of _dying in a pit_, they _scheme, betray, and hustle their way to the top_.
- **His Majesty the Worm** – Imagine _Dungeon Meshi_ crossed with **Ritualistic Guild Politics** and **interparty dynamics**. It’s **not** about kicking down doors—it’s about **negotiating with sentient fungi** and **performing weird rites to survive**.
  
✅ **Best for:** Players who want **scheming, power plays, and influence** over the world.

❌ **Skip if:** Your players want **clear objectives and action-focused play**—these settings are **slow burns**.

### **Final Recommendations**
  
If you still **can’t decide**, let’s cut to the chase:

**Want the best megadungeon?** → _Arden Vul_

**Want to feel like you’re in a Jack Vance or Gene Wolfe novel?** → _Ultraviolet Grasslands_

**Want a Ghibli-esque survival hexcrawl?** → _Hot Springs Island_

**Want eldritch Norse/Inuit survival horror?** → _Gods of the Forbidden North_

**Want a truly alien dungeon crawl?** → _Veins of the Earth_

**Want intricate faction play?** → _Yoon-Suin_

**Want to play out a criminal empire?** → _Blades in the Dark_

**Want dreamlike adventure in a setting that feels real?** → _A Thousand Thousand Islands_

**Want the best of all worlds, but set in a decadent, unknowable Dream-City?** → _Through Ultan’s Door_

### **Closing Thoughts**
  
No matter which one you pick, **you’re getting something unique**. The real question is **how much structure do you want?**

- **Tightly designed?** → _Stonehell, Blades in the Dark_

- **Player-driven sandbox?** → _Hot Springs Island, UVG, Yoon-Suin_

- **Completely surreal, emergent setting?** → _Through Ultan’s Door, Veins of the Earth_

**How much weirdness can your group handle?**

- **Low (Classic OSR dungeon delves)?** → _Arden Vul, Stonehell_

- **Medium (Faction intrigue, exotic cultures)?** → _Yoon-Suin, A Thousand Thousand Islands_

- **MAXIMUM UNHINGED MADNESS?** → _Veins of the Earth, ASE_
  

If you tell me **more about your players**, I can make **even more specific recommendations**—but at this point, I’d say **pick your poison** and **dive in**.
