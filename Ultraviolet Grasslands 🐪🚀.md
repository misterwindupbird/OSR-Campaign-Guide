A psychedelic science-fantasy road trip across a dying world.

### Key Features
- **Caravan-based hex crawl** – Instead of dungeon crawling, players **lead a caravan** across vast, surreal landscapes, managing resources, dealing with shifting trade routes, and uncovering strange ruins.
- **Long-haul exploration** – The game revolves around **slow journeys**, where every stop is a chance for **new discoveries, strange encounters, and risky deals**.
- **Surreal, heavy-metal fantasy** – Think *Moebius comics, Jack Vance’s Dying Earth, Mad Max*, and *Pink Floyd album covers*.
- **Weird magic and lost technology** – AI ghosts, fungal gods, psychic death rays, and liquefied souls are all just part of the economy.
- **Factions and city-states** – Powerful groups control the best trade routes and resources, from the **Porcelain Princes** to the **Spectrum Satraps**.

### Tone & Vibe
UVG is **dreamlike, psychedelic, and tinged with melancholy**. The world is vast, alien, and dying, yet still **bursting with color, eccentricity, and adventure**. The tone shifts between **heavy metal album covers** and **wistful, end-of-an-era stories**. Imagine an **ancient synthwave caravan rolling across a desert of violet grass**, stopping in strange towns full of mutant aristocrats, trading souls, and uncovering remnants of an unknowable past.

### How It Compares to OSR Tropes
- **Dungeons?** Rare. Instead of underground complexes, **exploration revolves around strange ruins, lost cities, and enigmatic landscapes**.
- **Treasure?** Not just gold—**technology, rare drugs, knowledge, or contracts with powerful entities** hold the most value.
- **Magic?** No Vancian spell slots. **Magic is unpredictable, often tied to ancient artifacts or psychic abilities** rather than structured spell lists.
- **Races?** No elves or dwarves—**porcelain-skinned nobles, fungal entities, time-lost wanderers, and forgotten AIs** take their place.

This isn’t a setting where adventurers **delve into dungeons for gold**. Instead, it’s about **long-haul travel, survival, and cultural exchange** in an unraveling reality.

### Pros & Cons

#### ✅ Pros:

#### ❌ Cons:

- **Players who want a world that’s colorful, surreal, and unpredictable.**
- **GMs who enjoy improvising** based on player choices rather than running a structured plot.

### Example Adventure Hooks
1. The **Faceless Bureaucrats of the Violet City** have commissioned you to **transport a shipment of “immortal paper”** to a secret buyer. They refuse to tell you what it does.
2. An **ancient bone-road** just reappeared under the grasslands, leading to **a city that shouldn’t exist**. Who built it? And why do its towers **glow with green fire**?
3. Your **caravan’s food supplies were poisoned** by an agent of the **Porcelain Princes**. Now, you have **three days to find a cure**, or you’ll all turn into **glass**.
