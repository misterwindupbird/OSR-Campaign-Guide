![Art by Huargo for my Issue 1 of my zine Through Ultan's... – @bio-occultist  on Tumblr](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a706cbb2b670094e902dc2afc6a1783a/tumblr_pmfs5aFvv71si5vllo1_640.jpg)



_Through Ultan’s Door_ is an evocative and surreal OSR setting that serves as an entry point to **Zyan**, the cursed city of the **dreamlands**, a decadent and crumbling metropolis floating above the **Endless Azure Sea**. The setting is spread across multiple zines, each offering expansions into the world’s **dreamlike geography, factions, and adventures**.

Players enter Zyan through **Ultan’s mysterious door**, which appears in the waking world. Beyond lies a realm of **oneiric wonder, baroque decadence, and creeping horror**. Adventures take place in three layers of the city:

- **Zyan Above** – A decaying dream city of **masked aristocrats, abandoned towers, and forgotten splendors**.  
- **Zyan Between** – The twisted undercity, filled with **winding catacombs, hidden shrines, and shadowed intrigue**.  
- **Zyan Below** – The **White Jungle**, an **upside-down rainforest** hanging beneath the city, teeming with **fungal horrors, lost temples, and ancient conspiracies**.

### 📖 Inspirations  
The setting draws heavily from:  

- **H.P. Lovecraft’s** _The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath_ (but with more **lush, lived-in weirdness**)  
- **Jack Vance’s** _Dying Earth_, particularly its **eccentric, amoral denizens**  
- **Clark Ashton Smith’s** dreamlike fantasy worlds  
- **Lewis Carroll’s** _Through the Looking Glass_ (but with a **darker, opium-tinged aesthetic**)  
- **Gormenghast**, with its **labyrinthine social structures and decaying grandeur**  
- The **courtly intrigue of historical cities** like **Constantinople and Venice**

_Through Ultan’s Door_ is one of the **most unique OSR settings available**, perfect for players who love the **aesthetics of Planescape**, the **weird intrigue of Lamentations of the Flame Princess**, or the **dreamlike horror of Veins of the Earth**. However, it requires a GM who is comfortable with **improvisation, baroque descriptions, and dream-logic mechanics**.
