### Tone & Vibe

Arden Vul is **epic, ancient, and immersive**, evoking the **feel of uncovering lost civilizations** in a vast, forgotten underworld. The dungeon isn’t just a **deathtrap**; it’s a **living world** where **factions shift, artifacts hold forgotten knowledge, and history lies buried under layers of stone and time**.

It leans into **historical and archaeological inspirations**—think **Byzantium, ancient Egypt, and the Roman Empire**, but long after their collapse. 🏺

As an **OSR setting**, Arden Vul is **as classic as it gets**:
- **Dungeons are the heart of play.** The entire campaign can be spent within its depths. 🏚️
- **Treasure equals XP.** Gold, relics, and lost tomes hold both **monetary and narrative power**. 💰📜
- **Vancian magic is standard,** with mages carefully managing their resources. 🔮
- **Tolkienesque races exist** but feel **worn and old**. Elves, dwarves, and their ilk have mostly faded, replaced by **humans and forgotten beings** that rule the deep.

If you want a **classic, high-stakes dungeon-crawling experience**, this is **one of the best options available**.
