- The dungeon has a rich history, from an ancient subterranean prison to a layered underworld of shifting factions, monsters, and mysteries.

- A focus on exploration, survival, and faction play, with random restocking ensuring a dynamic experience every delve.

### Tone, Vibe, and Inspirations
*Stonehell* is pure old-school dungeon crawling—think **Jaquaysian dungeon design, Gygaxian naturalism**, and a touch of **Hickman’s meat grinder philosophy** (but without enforced narrative rails). The tone is **brutal but fair**, rewarding clever play over brute force. If you love **grim determination, emergent stories, and slow mastery of a complex underworld**, this is for you.

Compared to OSR tropes, *Stonehell* is **straight down the middle**—Vancian magic, treasure as XP, classic dungeon factions, traps, tricks, and lethal surprises. There are no Tolkien races or high-fantasy epics, just a sprawling, deadly underworld waiting to be unraveled.

### Support and Materials
*Stonehell* is one of the best-supported OSR dungeons, with:
- **The main book**: *Down Night-Haunted Halls*, covering the upper levels.
- **Into the Heart of Hell**: Expanding into the lower depths.
- **Additional supplements**:
  - *The Brigand Caves*
  - *Buried Secrets*
  - *The Lost Level* (side content and extra dungeon wings)
- **Maps** are clean, easy to use, and the one-page dungeon layout makes running the game effortless.

### Example Hooks and Adventures
1. **Escape the Prison of Stonehell** – A captured PC or allied NPC is thrown into the dungeon’s depths—escape means braving the horrors below.
2. **Trustee Sniv’s Bargain** – The scheming kobold overseer offers you a deal—clear out his rivals, and you can keep the treasure (but can you trust him?).
3. **The Fungal Conspiracy** – Deep in the dungeon, strange glowing mushrooms are spreading—some say they whisper in the dark.
4. **Rival Adventuring Parties** – The PCs aren’t the only delvers—other treasure-seekers want what’s in the depths, and some are willing to kill for it.
5. **The Machine Awakens** – A bizarre, ancient construct stirs—what did the builders leave behind in the lost levels?

### Pros & Cons
✅ **One of the most playable megadungeons**—easy to reference and run.  
✅ **A true classic dungeon crawl** with rich faction play and mystery.  
✅ **Tons of support material**—expansions, maps, restocking tables.  
✅ **Dynamic play**—random restocking ensures no two delves are the same.  

❌ **Not much of a “living world”**—it’s a dungeon-first setting, with little focus on overworld politics.  
❌ **Can be overwhelming**—it’s massive, and newer GMs may struggle to track all the moving parts.
