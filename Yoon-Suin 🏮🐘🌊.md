### Yoon-Suin: The Yellow City and Beyond

Yoon-Suin is a setting of **opium smoke, caste politics, ruined dynasties, and esoteric mysteries**. The Yellow City, once a mighty empire, now drifts in a haze of decadence and forgotten glory, its noble **slug-men** presiding over tea houses and trading in **secrets as much as in gold**. Beyond it lie the **warring human kingdoms** of the Hundred Sultanates, the mist-shrouded **Mountains of the Moon**, and the **river labyrinths of Lamarakh**, each teeming with adventure, peril, and strange customs.

Unlike most fantasy settings, **Yoon-Suin is a toolkit, not a fixed world**. Instead of a setting book that tells you exactly what’s in every district, it provides **random tables and procedural generators** to create your own version of the Yellow City. Every **noble house, every tea house, every opium den, and every hidden faction** will be unique to your campaign.

### What Kind of Game Does This Support?

Yoon-Suin isn’t built for **traditional dungeon crawling**, though there are lost temples, deep jungles, and crumbling mountain monasteries to explore. Instead, the game leans into **social maneuvering, faction intrigue, and emergent storytelling**. Characters may be:
- **Outcast scholars** seeking esoteric knowledge  
- **Mercenaries** caught between rival opium cartels  
- **Wandering mystics** unraveling the secrets of an empire that never was  

Treasure is valuable, but **status, knowledge, and favors** are even more so.

There’s a strong influence from **Mervyn Peake, Jorge Luis Borges**, and **Indian & Himalayan folklore**, with a focus on **caste, ritual, and shifting power structures**. Magic is **dangerous, arcane, and unreliable**. There are no elves or dwarves—only **humans, slug-men aristocrats, crab-men merchants, and stranger beings**.

### Examples of Adventures & Playstyle

1. **A scholar’s corpse** is found in a tea house, strangled with his own prayer beads. Was he assassinated over the lost tomes he had unearthed, or was this **a case of karmic justice**?  
2. **A crab-man merchant** has smuggled a dangerous relic out of the Topaz Isles, but now he and everyone he trades with have been **marked for death**.  
3. **An opium cartel** hires the party to eliminate an upstart rival, but the job is complicated when **the rival’s daughter falls in love with one of the PCs**.  
4. **A guild of explorers** hires the players to map an **abandoned jungle city**, but the deeper they go, the more they realize that **the jungle itself is watching them**.  
5. **A noble slug-man** offers great wealth to whoever can recover the lost memoirs of a philosopher-poet. Unfortunately, they are rumored to be **in the library of a river pirate lord**.
