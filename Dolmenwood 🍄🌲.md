A **dark fairy-tale** setting of tangled forests, eldritch magic, and ancient secrets.  

---

### Overview
Dolmenwood is a **land of eerie enchantment**, where **pious mortals live uneasily alongside fairies, witches, and eldritch beings**. The setting draws from **British and Celtic folklore, gothic fantasy, and dark fairy tales**, creating a world where the mundane and the supernatural intertwine.  

In Dolmenwood, **nothing is quite as it seems**. The **woods themselves remember**, fairy bargains have **terrible prices**, and long-banished powers stir beneath the roots.  

This is a **place of mystery, strange beauty, and creeping dread**—where the **Cold Prince’s exile is whispered in song**, and **the Drune weave shadowed plots in hidden groves**.  

---

### Tone & Inspirations
- **Mystical, eerie, whimsical yet dark**—a world of talking beasts, enchanted foods, and ancient pacts, where fairy roads lead to places best left forgotten.
- **Inspirations:**  
  - *Gormenghast* – Decadent, crumbling nobility and baroque intrigue.  
  - *The King of Elfland’s Daughter* – Poetic, dreamlike fairy magic.  
  - *Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell* – Magic as folklore, rich with superstition.  
  - *The Wicker Man* – Rural folk traditions, secret rites, and eerie festivals.  
  - *Dark fairy tales* – The kind where witches grant wishes at terrible cost and children disappear into the woods, never to return.  

---

### How It Compares to OSR Tropes
- **Dungeons?** Some, but **more ruined castles, standing stones, and fairy roads** than traditional megadungeons.  
- **Treasure?** Yes, but **knowledge, bargains, and enchanted relics** can be more valuable than gold.  
- **Magic?** Magic is **folk-driven, ritualistic, and steeped in ancient superstition**.  
- **Playable Races?** No elves or dwarves—play as **mosslings (fungal folk), breggles (goat-headed nobles), or grimalkin (trickster cat-folk).**  

If *The Hobbit* is the fairy tale that reassures you, **Dolmenwood is the one that haunts your dreams.**
