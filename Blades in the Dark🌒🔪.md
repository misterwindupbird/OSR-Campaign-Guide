### Core Concept & Gameplay
- *Blades in the Dark* is a game about a crew of daring scoundrels navigating the underworld of **Doskvol**, a haunted industrial-fantasy city. Players take on the roles of **thieves, smugglers, assassins, and cultists** trying to carve out their share of the city’s criminal ecosystem.
- The game is heavily structured around:
  - **Scores** – Heists, assassinations, or other high-risk criminal enterprises.
  - **Downtime** – Recuperation, training, and faction politics.
  - **Faction play** – Negotiating, backstabbing, and manipulating the city’s various powers.
- Uses a **fiction-first, player-driven approach**, with *clocks* and *progress meters* tracking both short-term and long-term goals.
- Features **stress, flashbacks, and devil’s bargains**, encouraging cinematic action and risk-taking.

### Tone & Vibe
- **Dark industrial fantasy** with a heavy emphasis on **crime, ambition, and corruption**.
- Inspired by *Dishonored, Peaky Blinders, The Lies of Locke Lamora,* and *Thief*.
- The world is trapped in **eternal twilight** after a cataclysm shattered the sun; monstrous **leviathans** are hunted for their electroplasmic blood, which fuels the **lightning barriers** keeping ghosts at bay.
- **Magic is present but often terrifying and unpredictable**—spirits, demons, and occult forces lurk behind every deal and betrayal.

### How It Compares to OSR Tropes
- **Dungeons?** Not in the traditional sense—more about **urban heists, infiltration, and underworld intrigue** than dungeon-crawling.
- **Treasure as XP?** Advancement is based on **executing scores and handling the fallout**, not looting.
- **Vancian Magic?** Magic is **chaotic, occult, and tied to supernatural entities**—no spell lists, more like **rituals with unpredictable costs**.
- **Tolkienesque Races?** None—the setting is **human-centric**, though different regions and cultures have distinct identities.

### Unique Aspects
- **Faction Play** – The city’s **criminal organizations, noble houses, and cults** react dynamically to the players’ actions, creating an evolving world.
- **Flashbacks & Forged in the Dark Mechanics** – Planning is abstracted; players don’t plan in advance but **use flashbacks to justify preparations mid-action**.
- **Stress & Trauma** – Instead of traditional hit points, **characters take stress** when pushing themselves or resisting consequences. Too much leads to **trauma**, permanently altering the character.
- **Crew Creation** – The group collectively chooses a **crew type** (e.g., Assassins, Shadows, Cult) that grows alongside their individual characters.

### Example Adventure Hooks
1. **Heist:** The crew must break into a **wealthy noble’s manor** to steal a **cursed artifact**… only to find out **it’s possessed by a vengeful spirit that doesn’t want to be stolen**.
2. **Faction Conflict:** A war is brewing between the **Red Sashes** (fencing school turned gang) and the **Lampblacks** (brutal thugs). The crew is hired to **tip the balance**—through assassination, blackmail, or sabotage.
3. **Supernatural Horror:** A **whisper** (occultist) in the crew learns of **a demon trapped beneath a crumbling mansion**. If freed, it could **grant immense power… or devour their souls**.
4. **Political Manipulation:** The city’s elite are planning a **gala**, and a rival faction needs the crew to crash it—**stealing secrets, ruining reputations, and making a bloody statement**.
